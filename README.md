# K-means-Clustering

K-Means Clustering Project

Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. The project demonstrates how to use K-Means for data clustering and visualization.

Features

Implementation of K-Means clustering.

Visualization of clustered data.

Evaluation of clustering performance using metrics such as inertia.

Customizable number of clusters.
Content:

The main task of clustering is to identify natural groups within an unlabeled dataset. This means that clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task, which is important in many scientific, engineering, and business domains. This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation for a shopping mall using machine learning algorithms.
